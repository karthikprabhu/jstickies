#JStickies

JStickies is a simple, cross-platform sticky notes application based on Java. It enables you to easily synchronize your sticky notes to the cloud, so you can access them anywhere you like. 

Currently, JStickies supports synchronization with only Dropbox. Support for more cloud providers will be added soon.
